Pretty Inspect pi() function for puts-sytle debugging

It prints timestamp, file with line and function, from which was called.
By default inspected expression is used as label.
The output is colorized.
Returns inspected value, so can be seamlessly used in pipes.

All these features help to identify easily the place, from which the inspect was called.

## Usage

```elixir
  defmodule MyModule do
    use PI

    def func(variable_name) do
      variable_name
      |> pi()
      |> process_arg()
    end

    # ...
  end
```

Which will output in console, when MyModule.func/1 is called:

```
22:15:58 [my_module.ex:6: MyModule.func/1]
variable_name: "argument_value"
```
